        CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
        transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web
        Token (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices. The claims in a
        CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and
        CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application
        layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted
        about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a
        claim name and a claim value.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> is a standardized security token format
        that has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect deployments, among other applications.
	JWT uses JSON Web Signatures (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"/> and
	JSON Web Encryption (JWE) <xref target="RFC7516"/> to secure the contents of the JWT,
	which is a set of claims represented in JSON <xref target="RFC7519"/>.
	The use of JSON for encoding information is popular for
        Web and native applications, but it is considered inefficient for some
        Internet of Things (IoT) systems that use low power radio technologies.
      </t>

      <t>
        In this document an alternative encoding of claims is defined. Instead
        of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification uses
        CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/> and calls this new structure "CBOR Web Token (CWT)", which is a
        compact means of representing secured claims to be transferred between two
        parties. CWT is closely related to JWT. It references the JWT claims
        and both its name and pronunciation are derived from JWT. To protect the
        claims contained in CWTs, the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/>
        specification is used.
      </t>

      <t>
        The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
        "cot".

        The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is

        Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
        understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
        the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
        by implementations MUST be ignored.

      <t>The security of the CWT is dependent on the protection offered by COSE. Without protecting the claims contained in a CWT an adversary is able to modify, add or remove claims. Since the claims conveyed in a CWT are used to make authorization decisions it is not only important to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that the recipient is able to authenticate the party that collected the claims and created the CWT. Without trust of the recipient in the party that created the CWT no sensible authorization decision can be made. Furthermore, the creator of the CWT needs to carefully evaluate each claim value prior to including it in the CWT so that the recipient can be assured about the correctness of the provided information.</t>

	<t>
	  This section establishes the
	  IANA "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims" registry.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Values are registered on a Specification Required
	  <xref target="RFC5226"/> basis, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
	  However, to allow for the
	  allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve
	  registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
	  determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality,
	  whether it is likely to be of general applicability
	  or whether it is useful only for a single application,
	  and whether the registration description is clear.
