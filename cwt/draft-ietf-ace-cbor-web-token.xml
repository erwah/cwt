      <t>
        CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
        transferred between two parties. The claims in a
        CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and
        CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application
        layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted
        about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a
        claim name and a claim value.
	CWT is derived from JSON Web Token (JWT), but uses CBOR rather than JSON.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> is a standardized security token format
        that has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect deployments, among other applications.
	JWT uses JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"/> and
	JSON Web Encryption (JWE) <xref target="RFC7516"/> to secure the contents of the JWT,
	which is a set of claims represented in JSON.
	The use of JSON for encoding information is popular for
        Web and native applications, but it is considered inefficient for some
        Internet of Things (IoT) systems that use low power radio technologies.
      </t>

      <t>
        An alternative encoding of claims is defined in this document. Instead
        of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification uses
        CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/> and calls this new structure "CBOR Web Token (CWT)", which is a
        compact means of representing secured claims to be transferred between two
        parties. CWT is closely related to JWT. It references the JWT claims
        and both its name and pronunciation are derived from JWT. To protect the
        claims contained in CWTs, the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/>
        specification is used.
      </t>

      <t>
        The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
        "cot".

      <section anchor="CBORRelatedTerminology" title="CBOR Related Terminology">
        <t>
          In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a
          string.  In COSE, we use strings, negative integers, and unsigned
          integers as map keys.  The integers are used for compactness of
          encoding and easy comparison.  The inclusion of strings allows for an
          additional range of short encoded values to be used as well.

        The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is
        context dependent and is outside the scope of this specification.
        Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
        understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
        the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
        by implementations MUST be ignored.

        The claim values defined in this specification MUST NOT be prefixed with
        any CBOR tag.  For instance, while CBOR tag 6.1 (seconds-since-the-epoch)
	could logically be prefixed to values of the
        <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>,
	<spanx style="verb">nbf</spanx>, and
        <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx>
	claims, this is unnecessary, since the representation of the claim values
	is already specified by the claim definitions.
	Tagging claim values would only take up extra space without adding information.
	However, this does not prohibit future claim definitions
	from requiring the use of CBOR tags for those specific claims.

	How to determine that a CBOR data structure is a CWT is application-dependent.
	In some cases, this information is known from the application context,

	One method of indicating that a CBOR object is a CWT is the use of
	the "application/cwt" content type by a transport protocol.

	This section defines the CWT CBOR tag as another means for applications to

              there are three cases:
              <list style="symbols">
                <t>
                  If the CWT is a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1, follow the steps
                  specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg" /> Section 4
                  (Signing Objects) for validating a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1
                  object.  Let the Message be the COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1 payload.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0, follow the steps
                  specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg" /> Section 6
                  (MAC Objects) for validating a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 object.
                  Let the Message be the COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 payload.
                </t>
                <t>
                  Else, if the CWT is a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object,
                  follow the steps specified in
                  <xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg" /> Section 5 (Encryption
                  Objects) for validating a COSE_Encrypt/COSE_Encrypt0 object.
                  Let the Message be the resulting plaintext.
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              If the Message begins with a COSE CBOR tag, then
              the Message is a CWT that was the subject of nested signing, MACing,
	      or encryption operations.  In this case, return to Step 1,
              using the Message as the CWT.
            </t>
            <t>
              Verify that the Message is a valid CBOR object; let the CWT Claims Set be this CBOR object.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The security of the CWT relies upon on the protections offered by COSE.
        Unless the claims in a CWT are protected, an adversary can modify, add, or remove claims.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since the claims conveyed in a CWT may be used to make authorization decisions,
	it is not only important to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that
	the recipient can authenticate the party that assembled the claims and created the CWT.
	Without trust of the recipient in the party that created the CWT, no sensible authorization decision can be made.
	Furthermore, the creator of the CWT needs to carefully evaluate each claim value prior to including it in the CWT
	so that the recipient can be assured of the validity of the information provided.
      </t>
      <t>
        While syntactically, the signing and encryption operations for Nested
        CWTs may be applied in any order, if both signing and encryption are
        necessary, normally producers should sign the message and then encrypt
        the result (thus encrypting the signature).  This prevents attacks in
        which the signature is stripped, leaving just an encrypted message, as
        well as providing privacy for the signer.  Furthermore, signatures
        over encrypted text are not considered valid in many jurisdictions.

      <section anchor="IANACWTClaimsRegistry" title="CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Registry">
	<t>
	  This section establishes the
	  IANA "CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims" registry.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Values are registered on a Specification Required <xref target="RFC5226"/> basis
	  after a three-week review period on the cwt-reg-review@ietf.org mailing list,
	  on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
	  However, to allow for the
	  allocation of values prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve
	  registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.
	  [[ Note to the RFC Editor:
	  The name of the mailing list should be determined in consultation
	  with the IESG and IANA. Suggested name: cwt-reg-review@ietf.org. ]]
	</t>
	<t>
	  Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
	  an appropriate subject
	  (e.g., "Request to register claim: example").
	  Registration requests that are undetermined for
	  a period longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention
	  (using the iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
	  determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality,
	  whether it is likely to be of general applicability
	  or whether it is useful only for a single application,
	  and whether the registration description is clear.
	</t>
	<t>
	  It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are able to
	  represent the perspectives of different applications using this specification
	  in order to enable broadly informed review of registration decisions.
	  In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as
	  creating a conflict of interest for a particular Expert,
	  that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other Experts.

        <t>
	  This section shows a Nested CWT, signed and then encrypted, with a single recipient and a full CWT Claims Set.
	</t>
        <t>
	  The signature is generated using the private ECDSA key from <xref target="exampleKeysECDSA256"/>
	  and it can be validated using the public ECDSA parts from <xref target="exampleKeysECDSA256"/>.
	  The encryption is done with AES-CCM mode using the 128-bit symmetric key from <xref target="exampleKeysSymmetric128"/>
    with a 64-bit tag and 13-byte nonce, i.e., COSE AES-CCM-16-64-128.
    The content type is set to CWT to indicate that there are multiple
    layers of COSE protection before finding the CWT Claims Set. The decrypted
    ciphertext will be a COSE_sign1 structure.  In this example, it is the same
    one as in <xref target="exampleSigned"/>, i.e., a Signed CWT Claims Set.
    Note that there is no limitation to the number of layers; this is an
    example with two layers.
