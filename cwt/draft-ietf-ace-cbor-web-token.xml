        CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
        transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web
        Token (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices. The claims in a
        CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and
        CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application
        layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted
        about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a
        claim name and a claim value.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> is a standardized security token format
        that has found use in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect deployments, among other applications.
	JWT uses JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"/> and
	JSON Web Encryption (JWE) <xref target="RFC7516"/> to secure the contents of the JWT,
	which is a set of claims represented in JSON.
	The use of JSON for encoding information is popular for
        Web and native applications, but it is considered inefficient for some
        Internet of Things (IoT) systems that use low power radio technologies.
      </t>

      <t>
        An alternative encoding of claims is defined in this document. Instead
        of using JSON, as provided by JWTs, this specification uses
        CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/> and calls this new structure "CBOR Web Token (CWT)", which is a
        compact means of representing secured claims to be transferred between two
        parties. CWT is closely related to JWT. It references the JWT claims
        and both its name and pronunciation are derived from JWT. To protect the
        claims contained in CWTs, the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-cose-msg"/>
        specification is used.
      </t>

      <t>
        The suggested pronunciation of CWT is the same as the English word
        "cot".

        The set of claims that a CWT must contain to be considered valid is

        Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations to
        understand and process some claims in particular ways.  However, in
        the absence of such requirements, all claims that are not understood
        by implementations MUST be ignored.

        The claim values defined in this specification MUST NOT be prefix with
        any CBOR tag.  For instance, while CBOR tag 6.1
        (seconds-since-the-epoch) could logically be prefixed to values of the
        <spanx style="verb">exp</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">nbf</spanx>, and
        <spanx style="verb">iat</spanx> claims, this is unnecessary, since the
        representation of the claim values is already specified by the claim
        definitions. Tagging claim values would only take up extra space,
        without adding information.  However, this does not prohibit future
        claim definitions from requiring the use of CBOR tags for those
        specific claims.

	How to determine that a CBOR data structure is a CWT is application-dependent.
	In some cases, this information is known from the application context,
	such as from the position of the CWT in a data structure at which the value must be a CWT.
	One method of indicating that a CBOR object is a CWT is the use of
	the "application/cwt" content type by a transport protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
	This section defines the CWT CBOR tag as another means for applications to

                  (Signing Objects) for validating a COSE_Sign/COSE_Sign1

                  (MAC Objects) for validating a COSE_Mac/COSE_Mac0 object.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
	The security of the CWT is dependent on the protections offered by COSE.
	Unless the claims in a CWT are protected, an adversary can modify, add, or remove claims.
	Since the claims conveyed in a CWT may be used to make authorization decisions,
	it is not only important to protect the CWT in transit but also to ensure that
	the recipient can authenticate the party that assembled the claims and created the CWT.
	Without trust of the recipient in the party that created the CWT, no sensible authorization decision can be made.
	Furthermore, the creator of the CWT needs to carefully evaluate each claim value prior to including it in the CWT
	so that the recipient can be assured of the validity of the information provided.

        <t>
	  This section shows a Nested CWT, signed and then encrypted, with a single recipient and a full CWT Claims Set.
	</t>
        <t>
	  The signature is generated using the private ECDSA key from <xref target="exampleKeysECDSA256"/>
	  and it can be validated using the public ECDSA parts from <xref target="exampleKeysECDSA256"/>.
	  The encryption is done with AES-CCM mode using the 128-bit symmetric key from <xref target="exampleKeysSymmetric128"/>
    with a 64-bit tag and 13-byte nonce, i.e., COSE AES-CCM-16-64-128.
    The content type is set to CWT to indicate that there are multiple
    layers of COSE protection before finding the CWT Claims Set. The decrypted
    ciphertext will be a COSE_sign1 structure.  In this example, it is the same
    one as in <xref target="exampleSigned"/>, i.e., a Signed CWT Claims Set.
    Note that there is no limitation to the number of layers; this is an
    example with two layers.
